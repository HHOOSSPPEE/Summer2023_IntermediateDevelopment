## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the gameâ€™s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

	This assignment was the last project of the whole semester and I think it is the most challenging one. For this project, I had to try to design a complete game on my own and use my existing abilities to make it, not just copy and paste. I needed to find more ways to make puzzles in games on my own, so I needed to explore a lot of things that were not covered during class. My game is a puzzle horror game with pixel style, which mainly clone from the game "House". This includes the idea of loops, the horror scenes and style and so on. But I also made many changes, such as the decryption content and a lot of sprites, and used a lot of instant death triggers so that the player needs to pay attention to their own actions. I also used a lot of different soundtracks for the horror atmosphere, including but not limited to distress calls, cries, laughter, and horror songs. The biggest part of this project was actually drawing my own sprites, something I've been wanting to try for the last couple of assignments, and I was able to do so in Final Project. In this project I drew most of the animations frame by frame, including and not limited to character walking, staircase triggered death effects, toilet triggered death effects.I thought it would be easy. I thought it would be simple, but it was actually a lot of work and where I spent most of my time in the later stages. But fortunately the result is satisfactory in my opinion. I'm also grateful for all the relevant games that my classmates recommended to me during the course, which gave me a lot of knowledge of this kind games and a relevant addition to my own game library. This project has brought me a lot of benefits, and I hope to continue to refine this game to make it even better. After all, it's only part of the "Seven Mysteries of School" that I've included in the game now, and I haven't shown more of what I've planned yet. I'd like to try to add more gameplay elements, such as backpacks, archiving, delayed deaths, and more ways to play through the game. In this version, my gameplay is more on the instant trigger death side of things, so I think I can add more variations to make the game more playable.
     

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

5 - I think most elements of my preconceptions were accomplished in this project, and I try to add many elements, such as music and different sprites to make this game more close to horror genre. So I think I can get a 5 in this part.


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5

4 - I think I can try to make more changes in my games, like different enemies, different triggers to die and various methods to solve the puzzles. Thus, I consider I can get a 4 for getting passionate about trying more things.


**Overall** - Pass/Fail

Pass - I think I basically met the requirements for this final project and it ran smoothly and was somewhat interesting, so I can get a Pass.
