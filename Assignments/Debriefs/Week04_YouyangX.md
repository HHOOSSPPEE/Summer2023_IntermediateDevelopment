## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the gameâ€™s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

     For this assignment, I chose to partially recreate the scenes and characters from Ace Attorney and animated the movements or expressions of each character. The main moving character in the game is Phoenix Wright. In order to create animations related to this character, I searched for running materials related to Phoenix. The other characters I distributed according to the position and occupation of each character in the courtroom, and used the actions and expressions related to the original game. Unfortunately, although I did the grading for Phoenix's movement with different conditions in front and behind, I did not make a difference to the animation part. In fact, I could have set different animation content in each running part so that the character could follow his own direction of running. But I still like and am satisfied with this project. First of all, I'm happy to make a small expansion scene for a game I like, even though it's actually very minimal. Overall, I pretty much recreated the characteristics of the individual characters so that they could be animated in the game with relevant characteristics. I have to mention The Spriter Resource in the project, this website provided me with almost all the scenes and character materials, even though many of them are basically the same as the original game scenes and character animations. The running part does not even appear in the original game, more like DLC materials, but still very delicate and vivid. Secondly, I used Photoshop to remove the backgrounds of the characters and capture the parts I needed to apply to the game. I think Photoshop is a very useful program in terms of graphics, and it basically did everything I needed in this area. Finally, I found the background music of the characters in the game on Bilibili and chose Phoenix Wright's representative character music, which I think added fun and excitement to the game. And I remember my classmates suggested to me in class to integrate the character's characteristics into the game character. Although we had some different views on the characters, I still think this idea is valid. For example, I could set up a prison for the important villains in the game to add interest and better resonate with the audience emotionally. In the next related project, I think I might be able to make more changes or use some of my own handmade material to add to the game. Also, I consider I still have trouble with code, and I can improve it more in the next assignment.
     

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

4 - I think I finally got what I wanted for this project, and there are no obvious bugs so far, but I keep having problems with the export part, and that's something I need to fix urgently.


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5

4 - Overall, the content of my game is more geared towards an audience that knows the work in question, and I certainly hope that those who haven't played the game will be interested in the original game content because of my work. Unfortunately, I think I could have made more action changes for the Player in the game.


**Overall** - Pass/Fail

Pass - The final product largely met my expectations. Although there were some problems with the submission, I think I met the main requirements of the project. So I think I can get a Pass.
