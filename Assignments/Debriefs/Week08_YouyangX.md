## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the gameâ€™s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

	This assignment I thought was interesting. I had been experiencing the content covered in the assignment during our daily gameplay. And as I tried to craft the process we go through every day, I realized that parts I had previously ignored had actually been popping up frequently in my gaming life, and they were very important. Most of the content I produced this time came from what I learned in class. For this project, I chose to make a narrative game that tells a story about the bionic lover. I felt that the theme was very technological, so I chose some technological fonts and backgrounds to create the scene. In my vision, I wanted the players to be able to immerse themselves in the story and experience the world of the bionic man through the game. The Fungus plugin introduced in class was one of the parts I was most interested in. It was able to save me a lot of time by reducing the constant repetition of research I had to do while making the game. Although I did not include it in this project based on assignment requirements, I must admit that it helped me a lot in the development of subsequent topics. In addition to this, I searched the web for many resources on free fonts and sound effects, and Adobe Fonts, in particular, provided me with many font options. In Adobe Fonts, I found a large number of complete and beautiful fonts, and all of them were free and provided me with a lot of help. Furthermore, the works of other students in the class also inspired me a lot, especially in UI design. I think I can add more animations and innovative ways to display menus in my UI design to make the whole scene richer. I will try to incorporate these ideas into my next assignment. Overall, I'm very happy with the assignment. The code side is still the part I need to work on. The way I feel now, I'm more used to recovering and memorizing a string of code than trying to make more variations and combinations on my own. Or in another way, I'm still trying to understand the underlying logic of the code, like what they represent and where they lead. So there's still a lot of room for me in that area. All in all, by making this game, I not only deepened my understanding of what I learned in class, but I also discovered some important parts of game-making that I had previously overlooked. I look forward to continuing to develop my skills in future projects and creating even more exciting game experiences. 
     

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

5 - I think I basically met the requirements of the assignment and did not miss any points.


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5

4 - I think I could make more enhancements to the UI, such as adding animations or changing the way the menu opens. Perhaps more changes could be made to the scene-jumping aspect as well.


**Overall** - Pass/Fail

Pass - I think I have completed this assignment, so I can get a pass.
