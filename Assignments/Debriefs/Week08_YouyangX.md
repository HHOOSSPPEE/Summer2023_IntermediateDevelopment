## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the gameâ€™s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

	For this project, I ended up making a game similar to pinball scoring. Unlike the previous assignments, this one not only included the class but we were asked to make more changes and follow up. It was more like a simple mini-game rather than just being a part of the game. In this game, I used various physics engines to set up different animations for the scoring points in the game, which is the fish. And by using the player's control to move the small platform in the center of the screen, the black villain can touch the fish and get the score. I actually took a page out of Limbo's theme for this one, which is like a dark and dystopian style. It's a dark and dystopian style, which is actually very formative and can actually imply a lot of story in it. But due to lack of time and my current abilities, I just made a simple character-bouncing game. What's interesting about this game is that the villain will change his rotation and bouncing rhythm by the movement of the table in the middle of the screen, and the faster the villain rotates, the higher the score he can get. I tried playing it a few times on my own and found it to be quite entertaining. In completing this assignment, unlike the previous ones, I looked up a lot of information, such as watching the effects of different Physics Components and how to make the scene jump more smoothly. I actually had more ideas in my head, such as villains that could have special skills, or setting up more complex scenes already with different scoring points. Overall I think I still have a lot of room for improvement. From this project, I realized that the game is made up of a lot of pieces, and it's like I'm trying to build a game slowly, like building blocks. It is a complex but interesting process. For my next assignment, I think I can try to do more different things, like different animations, different character effects, and even more levels. Even I think that my current theme could actually work as a long-term development class. I'm actually kind of sad that I wasn't able to develop more of my ideal "Dark Fairy Tale" game this time around, including the storytelling, the action, and even the stories behind the characters. So I think I might try to continue this theme in my next assignment and develop more of the story, or even try to draw the character animations and scene animations for the game myself.
     

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

4 - I think I'm at the point where there are more things that could be developed. Like more level setups, and life values that change and different scores. Even on the art, I could have tried to make more changes. But the game basically runs smoothly and I tried to make it more fun, so I think I deserve this score.


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5

4 - I think I basically met the requirements in this assignment, and no obvious bugs were found in the runtime for the time being. but the submission was delayed due to personal reasons, so I gave myself this mark.


**Overall** - Pass/Fail

Pass - I think I basically met the requirements for this assignment, it ran smoothly and was somewhat interesting, so I can get a Pass.
