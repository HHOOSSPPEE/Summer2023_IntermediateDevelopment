## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the gameâ€™s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

     My project this time was to copy a photo in unity with simple graphics. I chose a landscape photo taken in Williamsburg and copied the image mainly in black and white. I really like the connection to game scene creation in this project. First of all, it was interesting for me to see how different graphics could be used in their own way to create a scene map with a back-and-forth relationship. In 2D games, various scenery shading is used to present the position of the characters in relation to each other. And in this project. I also felt this very deeply. In 2D creation in fact I often need to use the 3D view to move the graphics to achieve the back-and-forth effect, which is very interesting. What helped me most in this project were probably the hand-drawn pictures of various black and white landscapes and various materials about unity scene drawing. But in reality, I relied more on my unity graphics skills that I got familiar with through practice. In my next assignment, I will reuse this familiarity and try not to limit myself to unity graphics. I think I can try to add richness to the graphics by importing external files to make the graphics more visually appealing.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

5 - For this project I chose a landscape photo and processed it in black and white style. On top of that, I tried to add some animation effects to show the lighting. In my opinion, this project is in line with the requirements and what I personally wanted to achieve.


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5

4 - I think I've achieved the basic requirements in this project, and I think the final product is pretty good in my opinion, as it generally reproduces the photo effect I chose. Other than that, I think I could have tried to enrich the work by inserting external material, for example, as well as adding more details to the buildings in the picture and grouping them in detail.


**Overall** - Pass/Fail

Pass - I think I have no obvious errors in this assignment and it was submitted on time, so I can give a pass.
