## **Debrief**

I made a menu that navigates to three short animations. Viewing them adds instruments over a looping drum beat. I like how the music and drawings came out. They were rushed but a friend of mine thought the cat and frog were cute. I learned about switching scenes, managing audio with persistent objects, and UI interaction. There's not much else to say about the project. There's nothing I would do differently because it was a minimal concept that worked out how I imagined. I used one extra resource, this tutorial (https://youtu.be/_5ekbSrNcPU) for learning to manage audio between scenes.

## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

I think it was executed well. No bugs or anything wonky. The theme was metamorphosis, so the idea was to have the menu screen turn into different animals.


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5

It was minimal and fulfilled the requirements. It took me like two days.


**Overall** - Pass/Fail


I think it was a successful project. Not very detailed or extensive but I learned more about setting up and switching between basic scenes in Unity.
