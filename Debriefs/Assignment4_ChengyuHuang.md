## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the gameâ€™s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

I ended up making a game where the player plays as a pin ball machine. The idea for this game started out as a gamejam from GMTK, and the theme of that one was role reversal, so I wondered how about the idea of having the player play as a pin ball machine. Because generally speaking pin ball machine games make money from the pin ball machine, not from the player. Then I thought of some of the legendary machinations of casinos. So this game was made. In the game, the player can manipulate the objects on top of the pin ball machine, and the player can turn them on or off. The player can turn them on or off to make the ball pass through the objects to manipulate the direction of the ball. The purpose of the player manipulating the ball is to control the mood of the "player", because when the "player" loses money, their mood will drop, but the player will gain money, and the "player's" mood will go to zero which will result in the end of the game. Zeroing out will result in the end of the game. Then when the "player" wins, their mood will rise, but accordingly the player's money will decrease, and if the player has no money left, the game will end. So it's a game about balance. Players need to maintain the player's mood at a relatively high level before they can start earning money, while deliberately letting some balls stack up so that it's easy to let those stacks fall down to gain mood when the player's mood is too low. My favorite ASPECT is the balls, I tweaked various parameters of the balls to make them more like real-life balls, and I also made their collision boxes intentionally large so they can bounce around on the object more easily. The most useful resource was the ones I found online about ray cast and player input system, the principles of these things sound like they're complicated but they're actually a lot simpler than I thought they'd be, and likewise, a lot easier to do and not as scary as I thought they'd be. Incidentally, that player input system looks like it has a lot of unexploited potential. The next thing that will be repeated will definitely be the physical system, there's a lot of interesting stuff that can be done with this thing, not to mention that my next theme is TOO FAST a theme that would have gone well with the physical system.


Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*Write your elaboration within the asterixis*

My theme this time is sew, the so-called sew is to be able to freely sew all kinds of things to the clothes, so I made the process of players switching objects on and off to sew on and remove patches. I think it meet the theme I have

**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5

Even though I only had a couple days to work on this assignment after doing the gamejam I managed to produce the results I was hoping for. It's basically exactly what I thought it would be, not much of a difference


*Write your elaboration within the asterixis*


**Overall** - Pass/Fail Pass

I definitely think I did a good job of getting all the results I wanted in such a short period of time.
