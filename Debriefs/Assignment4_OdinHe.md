Debrief
In this project, I end up making a pinball game simulating the stock market, in which players need to control the ball to earn enough money in order to win the game. However, it is not an easy process that requires luck, effort, and a little bit of understanding of the game. The game aspect that I most like about this project is how the theme connected with the gameplay; the theme I chose for this game is marketing, so I decided, why don’t I make a game that simulates the stock market in a meme way? In the beginning, it was easy for the player to accomplish ed their goal because of the high bounciness of the ball, which I think represented the uncertainty of the stock market; however, when I tried the game, the falling of the stock market and its randomness and flexible wasn't present to me, but the falling of it is easy, so I decided that why don’t I see it in a different way? So I changed the topic that I wanted to present to the hardness and not easy to control, so by learning from games like Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy, I decided to give players a hard starting where they need to hit the ball out of the groove in order to start the game. However, it required skill and luck, whereas just like in the stock market, only the one with luck and knowledge can win. The resources that were most helpful to me were the TA and my friends, where the TA taught me what to do when I was stuck in certain places that I didn’t know how to do; in this project, it is how to make the pole that player can control moving and hitting the ball in the proper movement that I want to by, which is using different joints. My friend helped me a lot with how the theme of the game I could make based on the topic that I got; when I talked to them, some of the ideas that they came up with really surprised me and extended my idea of what I should do. What I will do differently next time is I will do more playtesting before I submit my work; I have found a lot of different bugs that I didn’t get when I played myself; a lot of playtesting can help adjust the bug and hear from other players about the difficulty of the game so I might make the player’s experience better.

Self Evaluation
Execution (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5
I think my project perfectly meets the theme I gave to it, which is a pinball game to simulate the stock market, where the player needs luck, skill, and the right state of mind inorder to accomplish the goal. When I played the game, players could feel the same emotion I had planted for their experience, so I will say it is a 5.

Scope (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 3.5
I will say I scoped the game fine, but not enough, there are some bugs that I can fix if I spend more time on this project, and if I spend more time with play testing, I will be able to adjust the hardness of the game so that player can have a better experience when playing my game. So I will say I scoped my game fine, with a 3.5.

Overall - Pass
I will say that I passed in this project, even though there were something that I might not do perfectly, however, the game fits the theme that I give it and present it clearly to players. Therefor, I think I passed this project.
