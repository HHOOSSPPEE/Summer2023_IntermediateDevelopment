## **Debrief**

In this assignment I had the word "Heavy" to work with, and so in order to have that mesh with the idea of multiple animations, I decided to go more specific and draw some of the largest animals instead. The game was super small, very zoomed in, and the animals all contained only two frames of animation, with the exception of some flowers in the background that I drew in for decoration that had like 10, and the player character with about 6. The idea had morphed at some point in time when I realized I should change idea and narrow my scope for the sake of time, so it doesn't entirely make sense that the player is a rock in the midst of a bunch of animals, but I allowed the narrative to suffer a touch. Though I'm not the biggest fan of flatgames in general, I kinda liked the simplicity of the two-frame animations because they were 1) easy to make and 2) made them more silly so I could then draw the animals more silly, and have it be less about realism and more about art, which is what I think is what flatgames are all about? I would say the comments that were most helpful to me were from the people that just said my game looked good and complete, because I really felt like there was more I could have done with it- whether that be more animals, more frames of animation, or having the background be far more interesting than a large green square sprite over the unity default blue. That is certainly something I would change if I had a little more time to work on it. I could do some waving grass or dirt paths, maybe to make it all make sense I could draw up some fencing and make it into a zoo? Which would mean changing the player character into a zookeeper. Although it makes sense why I probably did not come up with that at the time of creation, as I was actively avoiding people for the life of me while doing this (I cannot draw people), which is why this project has nothing to do with Sisyphus, because it certainly would have been about him and probably Atlas too if I was capable of that. But I tried to do the best that I could, and after seeing some other people's projects I think maybe I could start using The Spriters Resource more often than not to create a more full world, and also with the time crunch I had myself on I was only able to add a little bit of music to the game, and I usually like to have a little more than that so that would be different as well next time for sure. 

## **Self Evaluation**


**Execution** - 5

*I think I did a good job adapting the theme I was given into something more specific, because in the beginning I was going to do all things "Heavy" like rocks and vehicles and animals, before realizing how non-cohesive that would end up looking. Plus many of those ideas were static, and animals were the only ones that had definite movements that also gave me the most freedom of expression; unless I just really wanted to make a construction zone instead.*


**Scope** - 4


*I think by starting this project later than the last one, I ended up drawing my animations up until the very last night. In response to that I did have to plan to make my game a little smaller, and thus also had no static sprites to add to the art of the game, everything moved.*


**Overall** - Pass


*I'm not a huge fan of the flatgame style so I feel like no matter what I did it would feel somewhat silly and incomplete, but I didn't do anything "wrong," per say, and also I kinda did like my drawings so yeah I passed for sure.*
