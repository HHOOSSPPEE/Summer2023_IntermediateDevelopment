## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

In assignment 2, we made a start menu. I've always had a great interest in the UI design of games, so this was rather keen on this assignment. I had an existing game in mind, and it kind of fulfills two of the themes I have: tomorrow and resurface. However, I feel like it's more about the future than revealing the secrets of the past, as the protagonist has to face new adventures and deal with present challenges in the game. Therefore I picked tomorrow in the end. The game is about building a better tomorrow. The protagonist has to reveal the secrets of the family and be brave. There are a lot of opportunities associated with the word tomorrow, and the open-ended game should emphasize self-growth and acceptance. The protagonist has to, in the end, embrace her family heritage and take the responsibility that comes with it. The playing method shouldn’t be very hard as it involves extensive narration and some brain work to figure out the riddle. I wanted the game to have a nostalgic and warm style, and so I put forward a gentle and distinctive palette. The story would take place in a magical world with medieval elements; the figure of the guillemot should also be vital as it's the family's guardian animal and also plays an essential role in the plot. As a mystery-solving game, I tried to play with the backgrounds and buttons to implement surprises. UI often helps shape the game's first impression and is a crucial factor in the game. The start menu should include all the game's decisive elements and be eye catchy. It needs to introduce(advertise) the game to the player in a short time and inform them of the game's theme, style, and possibly playing method. I feel like this assignment is very meaningful to me as it makes me contemplate the usefulness of the start menu. I received many kind comments about the style of the interface, which could not have been made possible without Coolors: the palette website. If I have the opportunity to redo this in the future, I would probably go for a more exquisite style, as I kind of want the game to be fused with curls and delicate patterns inspired by medieval art. The pages now rather have simple designs that don’t well indicate the art style of the game. In addition, I could spend time working on the archive page, displaying more pictures and possibly different pages.



Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5
*5*
My theme is tomorrow. The start menu I made was aimed at a game that associated the past with the future. "The tomorrow of me is reminiscent of my past, even those I never know of." It's kind of hard to explain this concept in my brain without actually making the game.

**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4
*4*
I did my best including all the elements we learned during class. The only thing I discovered on my own was the postponing of sound and sprite transitions. I feel like there's possibility for me to be more creative on this open assignment.

**Overall** - Pass/Fail
*Pass*
My assignment does seem to meet the requirement of the start menu, with interactive buttons and submenus.
