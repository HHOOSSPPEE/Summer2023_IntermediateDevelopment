## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

In assignment 2, we made a flat game. A flat game is, to my understanding, a collage containing game elements. Therefore for the theme, I picked cliché. I decided to do a prototype of some genre of games. At first, I thought about doing a flat game based on UNTITLED GOOSE GAME, but I soon realized sprites resources should come before everything else as I didn't want to hand draw all of the sprites (plus the background as I want their styles to match.) Therefore I resolved to do a cliché collage of the Mario Series as there were loads of these sprites available for me. It's also one of the most important games ever and could be used as a representation of the whole genre. I like this project as it allows us to dive into the animations and be comfortable with them. I didn't quite follow during class as I didn't have the required sprites created by paint.net. Thus I was pretty nervous when I started the homework as I couldn’t remember the procedure of doing the animations. This assignment allowed us to explore the animation and animator panels fully, and to at least, make the sprites move.
I didn’t get to use paint.net at the end, which was a pity, but Photoshop’s also an excellent tool for dividing downloaded sprites, although maybe not as smooth and straightforward. I bought Aseprites, but it wasn’t as easy to use as I had hoped for. In addition, I got all my sprites from the spriters website. It was a blessing. I got a suggestion from Maia in which she pointed out to me that I could make the transitions based on the location of the camera. It was a really awesome idea, as the transitions could be both noticeable and achievable. I did not have a player because it would be ridiculous to have Mario flying between the platforms; the only reasonable solution would be to have a bird or a flying monster, but I didn’t find those on spriters. It would be interesting if Mario could respond to the perspective of the camera. If I get to do this project again, I will adopt Maia’s advice and make the standing animations respond when the player moves the camera. It would add more interactivity to the game without involving collisions and others. Also, a lot of my classmates use music in their games, which I think is super cool. I should probably try to incorporate more features into the game because Unity’s so much more than the class. Getting familiar with its functions and utilities would benefit us as we strive to become game designers.

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5
*5*
My theme is cliché, I displayed a bunch of game characters from the famous mario series in front of a commonly recognizable platformer background to imply the common impression of a platformer game.

**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5
*4*
I should have been more careful when I selected the sprites from online; some of them appear to have better resolutions than the other even though they were meant to be from a single collection. The game feels rough because of this. Also I actually would like to do a better transition of animations. I didn't figure out the best way to achieve this without a moving player.

**Overall** - Pass/Fail
*Pass*
My assignment does seem to meet the requirement of the flat game, with a moving camera, animations, and boundaries.
