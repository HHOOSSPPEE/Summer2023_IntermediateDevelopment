## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

In assignment 1, we made a collage using primitives in unity. We’re given the freedom to choose between the five themes we selected in the first class. Mine's based on a photo of a tower I took in Toledo, Spain. Its architectural elements clearly demonstrate Muslim influence over the region. The tower has a green and white mosaic pattern on the roof, which stands out among the grey/brownish walls and blue sky. I think the assignment really helped us to familiarize ourselves with unity and how to set the basics of making a game, which center around different objects and the background. I like the project because it allows us to create under specific conditions. I really spent some time trying to associate one of the themes with the photos I took. In the end, I resolved to create the easiest because all the other topics I have are more abstract, thus allowing me to be more creative in later projects, which probably are more game-like than this one. Unity, as a new tool, requires us to spend time practicing it in order to allow us to be comfortable using it. This assignment really gives us the opportunity to examine the features in unity. For this assignment, I first attempted to use set shapes like circles and squares and soon recognized their limitations. Rectangles are a lot more feasible than the others, but unlike adobe illustrators, it doesn’t allow one to modify the shape based solely on one of its anchors. I had some difficulties playing with them, but I figured in the end, what can’t be done by one rectangle can be done by two or more. The other issue that concerned me was the shadows; they were simply too many of them in the photo that I couldn’t necessarily draw out all of them. I selected the ones that stand most predominant in the photo, the ones that mark the dimensions of the building. In the future, I'll make sure not to select a background color that resembles the default one. Also, I figured I should probably not leave a third of the composition blank(with solid color): I got a comment to add some clouds. Although that would be rather hard to implement, I probably should think of a better way to make the image ample. In addition, I should also be more careful with the dimensions of the canvas and the direction of the photo. A horizontal composition would be a lot easier to work with than the one I did. I had to make a background myself in order to define the boundaries of the image, which moved from the edges automatically every time we resized the screen.

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5
*5*
My theme is travel, very straightforward and the composition I made shows a piece of architecture unique in the region of spain as it combines elements from Muslim and christian cultures.

**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5
*4*
I feel like I intended to do a more realistic style with the image. If I had more time, I probably would be more specific with the bricks and the shadows.

**Overall** - Pass/Fail
*Pass*
My assignment does seem to meet the requirement of the collage, with more than 200 game objects.
