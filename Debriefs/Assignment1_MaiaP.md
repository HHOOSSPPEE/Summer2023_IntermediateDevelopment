## **Debrief**
In this project I attempted to recreate a photo of a 5-year-long abandoned school that's a couple blocks from my house. I thought it was a good idea because my chosen word was "Empty" and from the backside you can see all the dirt and mold buildup, boarded up windows, and an additional four pools that are empty of water as well. Creating this was really helpful in learning how to use tools and layers. However I did not parent any objects because I didn't know it was a possibility until Tuesdays's check in. That's why the hierarchy was a mess, and was unfortunately unfixable due to layering reasons I don't fully understand, so that will be something I'll lead with next time. Also, another student mentioned that they were able to create specific shapes by using triangles, and I thought that was a very good idea because I struggled with the same issue but came up with a less efficient solution, and I will definitely be using that method in the future. Overall I found just being able to make realistic art to be satisfying and relaxing, and by spending so much time learning how to be efficient in the process, I will definitely be able to crank backgrounds out a lot faster in the future.

## **Self Evaluation**


**Execution** - 4


*I think I did a good job in finding a subject that fit the theme, and then was able to recreate it fairly accurately. I would only say that by choosing a more dull or muted color palette I would have been able to better capture "Empty" in the mood sense, as opposed to what I had which was just the literal.*


**Scope** - 5


*I knew from the beginning that I was going to enjoy doing this project, so I started working on it the very next day. So I never had need for scoping, because I was done early and did everything I wanted to, and anything additional (like making the fence actually made of thousands of tiny cross sections) would have been far too much to even consider.*


**Overall** - Pass


*I think I did a good job. I'm proud of the work I did, and can even see myself putting it in a game granted I could make it work one day.*
