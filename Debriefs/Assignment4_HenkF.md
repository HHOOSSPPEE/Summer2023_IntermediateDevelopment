## **Debrief**

For this assignment, I initially faced some difficulty selecting between my two draft themes: "Key" and "Crawling". At first glance, these two themes appeared to have no direct connection to a pinball game and I found it difficult to decide which one to choose. After careful thought, I settled on the theme "Key", as it inspired me to devise a game where the color of the pinball needs to match the color of the key to advance through the levels. The term "Crawling" did not spark any engaging ideas for this type of gameplay, so I elected to focus on the theme of "Key".
This decision led me to combine elements of puzzle-solving with traditional pinball, which resonates with the theme of a "Key". Thus, "Hue Rollers" was born â€“ a game aimed at providing a puzzle-solving experience while maintaining the core gameplay elements of pinball. Players must bounce the ball to different areas either to score points or acquire the key. However, simply placing keys on the game map felt too easy. To add complexity, I integrated the concept of hue, requiring the ball's color to match the key for it to work. This introduced a second layer of puzzles for players to navigate.
As for what I particularly like about this project, I am pleased with the current simple yet colorful palette, the geometric art aesthetic, and how well the background music and in-game assets mesh together. The result is a game that feels polished and stylistic. Additionally, I am content with the variety of collision interactions embedded within the gameplay, which enhance the player's experience.
The feedback received during the critique was insightful, as it offered a fresh perspective on my game and pointed out issues I had previously overlooked. One such comment was the need for more vivid color-changing cubes, to help players understand how these blocks differed from others. This critique made me realize the pitfall of design bias, where I had wrongly assumed players would inherently understand the mechanics without clear guidance. More playtesting would have helped prevent this.
Furthermore, the critique that the game was overly difficult was helpful, as it gave me insights into initial player reactions. To make the game more accessible, I'm considering adding a mechanic where the force of the flippers is adjustable and the initial trajectory of the ball can be seen before release.
If I were to revisit this project, I would reduce the game's difficulty by simplifying the color puzzles. I would also investigate the mechanics of force application further, to explore whether I could achieve the desired effect I mentioned earlier.





## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** - 5

I achieved all the required goals from the assignment, and I elaborated on puzzle solving and level design. The theme Key matches the gameplay perfectly.

**Scope**  - 5

By maintaining this minimalist yet geometrical visual aesthetics, I could do this project fairly quickly without overspending time on art assets. The game mechanics of this game is also fairly accessible in terms of coding, clearly, this project is not over-scoped.

**Overall** - Pass

This physics project is undoubtedly a success where I achieved all the goals yet created a unique visual style and aesthetics.
