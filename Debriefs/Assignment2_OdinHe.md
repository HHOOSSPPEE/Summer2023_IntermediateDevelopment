Debrief

In this project, I end up making a flat game about a Sudowoodo explaining a forgotten villa in the middle of nowhere, figuring out what happens to the villa, and exposing the evil plan of team rocket; if players explore enough, they can even meet Mewtow, the famous legendary pokemon. The game aspects that I most enjoy and love in this project are what I have done to make the story. This project was basically a walking simulator, so the story that the player will experience in the game becomes very important because it is what the player will see and build up their game experience. So I decided to remake the story in Pokemon Red and Blue, where the game doesn’t show what happened to team rocket and Mewtwo, so I remade the scene and added player control so players can explore the map, see what happened between team rocket and Mewtwo, and find out the back story of one of the most essential news in the Pokemon world. The theme I chose for this game was breaking news; my understanding of breaking news means something big happens, and the people who the player control should be an observer, so I came up with the Mewtwo idea. The first resource that was very helpful for me during the creation process was the class recording. Whenever I have stuck on things that I don’t know how to do, I can just open the video, watch it again, and I get the answer that I need. The recording was also a good way for me to visit if I want to review what I have learned in the previous class and when I feel like I did something wrong in my project. The help from my TA and classmates where also a very important resource I could get for my project. When I finished my project, the first thing I did was let my friend try it; after playing with my project, my friend gave me a lot of recommendations, such as what I should do for the map, the background music, and the character move speed, after I fixed them, the game gets better. The help from my TA was also necessary; when my character slowly sank under the scene, it was the help from my TA I learned how to fix it. What I will do differently next time is probably call for help when I first meet the problem, not after a long time trying to figure it out by my self, which was a lot of time.

Self Evaluation

Execution (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

My project perfectly meets the theme I gave to it. I tried many ways to explore the theme, and it worked perfectly, and I spent a lot of time on my project to improve it.

Scope (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5

I scoped my game very well. The player can explore the map with curiosity, find the secrets hidden around the map, and finally answer all the questions when reach the end. 

Overall - Pass

My game worked very well as the theme; I spent a lot of time on the game, and the story the game presented was good, so it passed.
