## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

In assignment 4, I made a pin monkey game that somewhat resembles a pinball game. The player uses their mouse to control the direction and the speed of the ball; in addition, they can also use the left/right keys to manipulate two pair of arms to block the ball from falling. I like this project because it let us explore physics in Unity, and for the first time, we actually created a complete game where there's an entry page and restart button, along with music and graphics. However, as I'm not too familiar with Japanese archive games, I was pretty bewildered when we were first given the task and had to go over the tutorials of pinballs on youtube. In the end, I still didn't grasp the essence of the game, and I do hope the assignment can be a little bit more straightforward. I got the physics and interaction part, but I guess just not the random interaction part. The youtube video didn't really help me as it described the whole mechanisms, and because it wasn't a simple game machine, it contained many parts. I didn't really know which one I wanted to do. After I saw the assignments by my classmates, I almost wished I could have the chance to remake this game because it wasn't my version of the pinball game. A lot of people pointed out to me that the movement of the ball isn't very controllable with the mouse, and I know it's because of the gravity vector I set up. The launch angle curved after a few milliseconds, which decreases the players' sense of controllability of the game. I should probably play around with the speed and the gravity vector a bit more to offer a better interaction experience. If I have the opportunity to remake this game, I would consider making the monkey sprite the player, as the game is called Pin Monkey anyway. The only reason I didn’t do that was because I didn’t know how to enact the collisions and the rotations when my ball(the monkey) hit the boundaries and obstacles. A symbol circle sprite is much better in this sense. Also, I would give the arms a force-up so that every time when the player lands on the arms, it could go upward without the involvement of a mouse click. It. It makes more sense because that’s what is happening inside a pinball machine. I thought it was sufficient for the player to use their mouse, but I want the players to have more ways to interact with the game environment; giving the arms extra ability could enrich the game experience.





Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5
*4*
My theme is alarm. I set up a timer in this game: the player has to successfully hit the monkey at the top of the screen in a limited time period, which gives the players a sense of timeliness. However, using only the timer as the alarm, I feel like I could elaborate on this more. 

**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5
*4*
The game is, in my opinion, a completed experience. It's in many area very coarse, and have many potential aspects that I could improve on. For example, an ending page that records the result of the game and different physics materials.

**Overall** - Pass/Fail
*Pass*
My assignment does seem to meet the requirement of my version of the pin ball game. Even though it doesn't bear much resemblance, it does fulfills all the requirements of this assignment.
