## **Debrief**
For this assignment, I didn't devote much initial thought to the application of my chosen theme. Instead, I decided to keep a watchful eye out during my everyday activities. Quite serendipitously, while shopping at Urban Outfitters, I spotted a heating unit. The view from the second floor offered an intriguing composition that fit perfectly with my chosen theme of heat. Consequently, I decided to take a photograph of it and replicate the scene.
Regarding the outcome, I am quite satisfied with the overall composition and perspective, which align well with the original image. The collage style of the artwork works impressively, infusing the image with a unique vibe that deviates from the original photograph. In particular, I spent most of my time working on the pipelines and the heating unit itself. I am extremely pleased with how I managed to replicate round objects and perspectives using only squares and triangles. Through this exercise, I discovered the versatility of triangles in replicating almost any shape.
For this assignment, the triangle was undoubtedly the most useful shape. It facilitated the replication of perspectives and rounded shapes. My strategy entailed using the edges of triangles to replicate outlines and squares to fill in color. The combination of these two shapes proved quite effective, as demonstrated by the end result. If tasked with creating another image using basic shapes, I would certainly incorporate circles into my toolbox. After observing how my classmates used circles to replicate curved shapes, I'm inspired to do the same.


## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** - 5

I successfully matched the shape and perspective of the selected images using only triangles and squares. My presentation of this image was stylish yet faithful to the original.


**Scope**  - 5


The creation process for this image took me around three hours, a duration that seems reasonable for smaller projects like this. I didn't encounter issues with time constraints, nor did I need to reference numerous videos to aid me in completing the image.


**Overall** - Pass


This assignment is undoubtedly a success. I've replicated the original image accurately, and it aligns perfectly with my chosen theme of heat, given that I'm physically presenting an object associated with heat.
