Debrief
In this project, we needed to design a starting menu for my theme, ghost hunting; the first thing that came up in my head was the movie Ghostbusters, so I decided that why don't I design a menu for a game that kind simulate the process of catching ghost, using different methods, and caged them. When someone talks about catching things, the first thing that comes up in my head is Pokemon, so I make a starting menu for a game where players need to catch ghost Pokemon in a hunted mansion. Also, when talking about villas, I remember the classic game Luigi's Mansion, so I decide to make the title a Pikachu and pay tribute to the cover of Luigi's Mansion by doing the same pose. After deciding what my theme would be, I started to think about what I should put in the UI so that players could interact with and fit the theme; I want to use the ability for players can click around the button, and the button will disappear, and by changing the spirit, I made the button the shape of Gastly when player click on the Gastly, it will disappear, to represent the Gastly get catch by player. The most helpful comments were comments from my friends; when I showed my design to them, they provided valuable feedback about the music in the background, where I used to have loud background music. However, my friends told me that the background music was too loud, and they couldn't hear the sound effects the buttons made when the player clicked on them. Also, the help from TA was beneficial because I got a bug when I explored my game in webGL form; after I talked with TA, she helped me fix the problem right away. What I will do differently next time will be to make more code with the ghost generator. My original idea was that there would be different types of ghost Pokemon generated on the map randomly, and for different types, players need to click on the other Pokemon balls to catch them; however, after trying many times, I realized that there might be more code that I need to learn to finish what I imagined, so I decided to keep it simple now. The next time I do a project like this, I will finish what I originally planned. The thing that I will keep the same will be to let my friend play test my game so that they can provide some helpful feedback, and I didn’t see when playing myself.


Self Evaluation
Execution (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5
The project fits the ghost-hunting theme I give to it. Players are able to experience a scary and exciting ghost-hunting starting menu, and they are able to interact with it. 

Scope (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4
I think I scoped the game fine, even though there are some things that I originally planned to do and didn’t accomplish; however, I did what the professor had told us to do during class, and also I explored what I could do in Unity, so I think I scope the game fine.

Overall - Pass
I think my project achieve the theme I give to it; I try hard to make it looks great and works fine, and it turns out to be cool and unique, so I think I pass.
