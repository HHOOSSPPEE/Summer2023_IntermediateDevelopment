## **Debrief**

I made pretty much normal, rudimentary pinball. There's bumpers (green triangles), bouncier point multipliers (yellow), less bouncy obstacles near these, and shapes with more friction at the lower corners. The flippers work with hinge joints and the menu is a change of state in the same scene. A new feature I learned was tags, to easily distinguish between and assign point values to collisions. I didn't take much artistic liberty with the structure of pinball as this is a late submission and not a genre I have passion for, so there's not much I can say in the way of subjective design.

## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 4

My theme was routine, expressed by the restart option.

**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5

Well. It wasn't overly ambitious, expressed knowledge in the taught material.

**Overall** - Pass

I think it was a successful project. Not very detailed or extensive but I learned more about physics, tags, and collision.
