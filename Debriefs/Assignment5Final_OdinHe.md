Debrief

In this assignment, I end up making a roguelike version of Stardew Valley; in this game, players need to defeat Cthulhu monsters, plant seeds to heal themself, and try to survive as long as they can before they reach the correction level of 100. The game aspects that I liked about this project were the process of making the plants growing system and the random generating enemy system. When I began with this project, I was overwhelmed with what I should do first, so I decided that why don’t I start with the plant system first? By creating a timer and changing the sprite array, the plants are able to grow up based on how long it has stayed on the map, and when the plant reaches stage 5, by checking the collision, the player is able to eat the plant. The random enemy generator was another approach I made in the game, where it was used to instantiate and generate enemies all around the place with a random pattern. The resources that were most helpful to me were help from teachers and TA, also videos on Youtube. When I reached some question, the first step I did was when to Google and search the question to see if there were someone that met the same problem as me, so I could learn from them, such as when I tried to create a timer. If there were no answers, I would ask TA and professor to see what I had done wrong or how to solve the problem, such as when I meet the problem of how to use prefab, where I can’t plug an object into the prefab I made when I ask the TA, she told me that the object needs to be inside prefab too in order to plug it in another prefab. Also, the class record was very useful when I met problems that we had learned before, so I could review the video to see if there were some solutions; when I met the problem of jumping around scene, I just rewatched the video that we go over transferring scenes, and I got the answer. I will repeat next that I will keep exploring the field of things we haven’t learned in class and trying to extend what we have learned to make my project even better. And what I will do differently next time will be to seek more help when I got problems that I can’t solve instead of trying to solve them by myself.


Self Evaluation

Execution (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5
For the curse theme I give to it, I think it perfectly matches the game I made. In the game, the player’s whole idea was to not let themself get corrupted by the power of Cthulhu, which is a curse. When players get too influenced by Cthulhu, the game will end. The whole town was cursed, and the player will fight against their fate, however, the game will never end, because it is the curse of Cthulhu.

Scope (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4.5
I think I scoped my game fine, when I tried to make the original idea, it seems it is too big for a two-week-long project, so I decide that about I keep the two main systems, planting and fighting monster. Even though there were some small bug left on the game, however, I tried very hard to fix everything so it will run, doing the process, I reviewed most of the things that we have learned during this semester, and even extend them so the game will present in a better. So I think I have done the game fine.

Overall - Pass
I think I passed this project because during the process of creating this project, I have done what I want it to be, review things that we have learned during this semester, and even extend on what we have learned. The Game also fit the theme I give to it, so I think I passed the project.
