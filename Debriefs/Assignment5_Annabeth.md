## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

I put a lot of thought into this assignment. I reserved the keyword resurface for the last assignment because I thought I could create a whole story and do a mystery-discover type of game, but it bewildered me when I learned it would actually be a clone game: We had to borrow elements from a different 2D game. I haven't played a lot of 2D games, and the theme didn't really work with the ones that had something I would like to clone. I really wanted to do Overcooked because it's my favorite multi-player game, but apparently, there was only so much I could do with the theme resurface. I thought of doing a fishing game or a submarine game, but I really wanted the narrative to be part of the final project. In the end, I decided to borrow the shifting characters element from Overcooked and created a story based on a tiktok video I saw. The gameplay would then resemble the escapist, though a lot simpler. The story goes like this: a pair of twin brothers turn out to be cousins as their parents both have twins that died in a car accident; they then remarry to give the brothers a complete family. My game is based on the story and features an investigation where the twins resurface the truth through collecting things. I like this game assignment because we have enough time to create something truly unique. I wish it could allow us more freedom though I can see how a game clone could inspire as long as restrict our game choices positively. I could have struggled with my gameplay if we didn't have to clone a different game, and I'm glad for the final result. I struggled to find game assets as I didn't want to do pixel art this time. The professor pointed out to me that the tutorial in the front isn't sufficient to direct the players because there are too many things to remember. I think it's a really good suggestion, and if I have time to improve the game, I'll include an instruction icon in the corner for further information after the game officially starts. I also wanted to improve the tutorial in which I could use Lua, which I'm not very familiar with. In addition, I wish to do a more detailed ending instead of having only written words. The interactions between the two characters are also kind of weird since I’m using the same script for both, so technically, the thought bubbles will be triggered no matter where the collision occurs. I should figure out a better solution to do this. Overall, I'm happy with the outcome and I couldn't wait to do more things with unity.




Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5
*4*
My theme is resurface. My final project is about resurfacing the truth of the family. I think I tried reallly hard to incorporate the theme.

**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5
*4*
I think the scope is probably alright as I did somehow managed my goals and offered a complete game.

**Overall** - Pass/Fail
*Pass*
My assignment does fulfills the requirement: the theme and the clone.
