## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

I ended up with a walking simulator for Eevee, in which the player will play as Eevee and walk around in a scene I built. Explore some of the scenes in the game. There are two different scenes in the game. The first scene is a relatively empty scene, where there is a house, the player can walk into that house. In the house the player will find that they have arrived at a lively celebration scene. In the game the player can operate the character has 8 different animations. The player walks with four different animations, and when the player stops there are different idle animations depending on the previous orientation. Other than that, all the other Pokémon have a loop animation of their own. Used to show the joy because of the release of the kingdom of tears. Although, I cannot do much, but I still added a collision in the game used to switch scenes. Finally, I added a music player to give the whole scene a more celebratory flavor. My favorite is the eight animations of Eevee and this little guy. I went through a very complicated animation switching web to switch between these eight animations. I kind of like this one. Also, I slightly modified the code used to switch the animation, because I found that every time I pressed another direction while moving in one direction, the animation would get stuck. So to prevent this, I locked the player direction while the player was holding the button. Probably the most useful resource is the sprite sheets of those Pokémon. These sprite sheets are very comprehensive and cover basically everything I want. From each direction of movement animation to, injury or attack animation, even if this time cannot use these things can be used later. Next time I will repeat something first of all is the animation system, a vivid animation system can bring a lot of juice effect to the game. and this is not difficult to do, so why not? But next time I will revise the animation switch, I want to think of ways to modify it, but it is better silky smooth. The second thing I want to repeat is the camera movement, this camera movement is very good, since this is very good, then next time should be repeated more. But I also need to modify it, because I forgot to modify the background and the camera limit.


Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*Write your elaboration within the asterixis*

I think it still fits my theme, because my theme is revelry which means celebration. So it thought about what would be suitable for the celebration. I thought of the game release when everyone gathered to celebrate the scene. So I made a Nintendo character to celebrate the release of the Kingdom of Tears scene.

**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4

Originally wanted to do a more ambitious parade, but time was not quite enough for me to make a huge parade scene, so I made a scene of a treasure dream celebrating inside a hut. The difference is almost the same, but it always feels a little worse. Of course the main point of the deduction is that I forgot to adjust the camera settings, resulting in the final product and the unity default background, which is unacceptable to me.

*Write your elaboration within the asterixis*


**Overall** - Pass/Fail Pass

I forgot a few things and some of them didn't make me very happy, but after all, it was only a week only. So I actually think I'm doing pretty well.

*Write your elaboration within the asterixis*
