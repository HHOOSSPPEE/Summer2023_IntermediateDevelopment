## **Debrief**

For this assignment, I was initially overwhelmed by the plethora of ideas and concepts I wanted to make in terms of UI design. However, after deliberating on the interconnection between my draft themes and personal concepts, I selected the theme "Escape." This decision was influenced by an ongoing game project I've been working on, named "The Frontier," a space survival RTS game. I found this project malleable enough to allow the adaptation of my original idea to the selected theme as I foresee the connection between the future and escape. Thus, I chose to modify some of my game concepts to align more closely with the "Escape" theme.
Simply changing the name from "The Frontier" to "Utopia" was not enough; I felt the need to modify its design elements, particularly the visual representation, to embody the escape theme vividly. The original game focused on survival in harsh environments and battling against aliens. The future depicted was not bright, and the overall aesthetics were quite dark. In contrast, for this assignment, my UI visual representation suggests players stepping into a luminous utopia through the bright use of color and minimalist UI elements.
Regarding the outcome, I am genuinely pleased with the overall visual representation where I meticulously arranged the UI, especially the options menu where I spend hours aligning the details within the menu and changing up formats and structure. In addition to the UI, I am pretty satisfied with my transition effects and the spaceship I crafted using Blender. While these elements successfully convey the concept of "Utopia,” I’m really happy that our TA Samira noticed the meaning behind the transition between UI, that I was trying to create a sense of players actually configuring the spaceship in the options menu.
During the process of creating this project, I found Pinterest and YouTube to be invaluable resources. These platforms enabled me to acquire inspiration and rapidly learn 3D modeling and rendering skills. Besides these software tools, the comments from my classmates proved to be immensely beneficial. They helped me identify potential enhancements for my future work.
Undoubtedly, my design is not flawless, but I am grateful for the opportunity to observe how others react to my work. For future projects, I will focus more on the accessibility aspect of UI design, as it is a pivotal factor in player engagement and enjoyment. While I am pleased with the current state of my design, I am eager to explore and experiment with how I can make the UI more dynamic without compromising its aesthetic elements in my future assignments.




## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** - 5

All the requisite goals were successfully accomplished, with a detailed elaboration on the options menu of my game. The overall visual representation and user interactions within this user interface design have left me quite pleased.

**Scope**  - 5


The construction of this user interface took several hours and involved a range of software tools to support the process. This assignment called upon all of my existing Unity knowledge to create the effects in the UI. It did not put me in challenging situations that required searching for information or spending countless hours learning new concepts. Therefore, I firmly believe that I fit seamlessly within the scope of this assignment.

**Overall** - Pass


This assignment has undoubtedly been a success. I was able to adapt my initial concepts to align with the "Escape" theme. The UI echoes this theme effectively, and the layout and visual elements are aesthetically pleasing.
