## **Debrief**
I picked the word "Mine" for this project, and before I design what I want for the menu page, I sort of brainstormed what this mining game would be like if I were to actually make a game out of it. I want the game to work sort of like a combination of Minecraft and Terraria but a way simpler version and maybe let the cat be the avatar of the player. I want the game to be in pixel style, so I found a pixel font that is free for personal use. I also really like the vibe of Minecraft interface so I made the scaling animation and a version text on the bottom. I don't think I left much information on how to play the game in the menu interface though. I drew the initial spawn point of the player, and indicate to the player that there were going to have different biomes in this game. The character has a pickaxe in its hand and it's standing in front of the entrance of a mining cave to indicate that the goal of the player is to mine. Still, I didn't put much information about what the player would get out of the cave, although I actually prepared a background with only the diamonds, gold, silver, etc. It only shows up after you click on the start button(because I remember that Minecraft has a loading page that shows the side of the dirt blocks). And then I started to focus on the character because I just really love playing with the options of character customization. I drew cats of four different colors and then used a button switch sprite(I forgot the exact name but it replaces the original sprite with the sprite that I assign it with.) And then I also want the option block to be checked after the place clicked on it to indicate that it's already been selected. And that's also done by replacing the sprite. It requires some repetitive work, I think there are definitely better ways to do it but I just used that button option for all of these sprite changes for each of the buttons. I wish I could just copy paste but once the name changes it resets everything. At last, I want to test some more animation on my UI page so I added a light yellow when the player clicks on the option, and that yellow will cover up the background and leave only the important information to the player.

## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

My procject meet the theme of mine. I think the cat is cute although it's not really related to mining but the cat has pickaxe on its hand!!


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4.5


*My elaboration*

I feel like I scoped this assignment the way I want it to. Although there's some improvement I could make so that it looks better. I could have made two/three fonts with different color so that the credit page looks clearer. 

**Overall** - Pass


It should be an okay work.:)
