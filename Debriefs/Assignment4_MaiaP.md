## **Debrief**
For this assignment, I made a pinball game with the theming of "Growth." I felt the word was a little tricky for a pinball game but I really wanted to save my other word so I tried my best to make it work. In my search for nonliving things that grow, I decided to make a snowball rolling down a hill a mechanic, defaulting the rest of my theming to winter. I would say this was a pretty hard project. Unity physics aside, I didn't really have a good grasp of what went into a pinball machine in the first place and did research. Accidentally and ironically, once this project was over I caught the second half of the movie "Pinball: The Man Who Saved the Game," and it turns out looking up the rules of pinball was confusing for me because in it's history, pinball has gone through many iterations in order to keep it legal, since it used to be considered gambling. With this new info, I feel like I may have strayed away from the heart of pinball because my theme made the game less about skill. However, ball aside, I created pegs, bouncers, and flippers. The pegs were fairly easy, I tried to keep them near the top of the level due to the growth mechanic so the possibility of the ball getting stuck was small. The bouncers gave me similarly little trouble, since I created them after the growing snowball code, so they were a simpler version of that. The flippers were the most difficult part. I'm not entirely sure what went wrong with my hinge or spring joint, but the flippers would get stuck in the upwards position if I made their speed too fast, so I had to keep it slow, making the flipper feel heavy and less responsive. After hearing critiques on their movement at their final form, I think it may have been easier to write it into code since the movement I wanted it to do is fairly simple in concept. I also never set up a good way to launch the ball, because to get started in the beginning I gave the ball the same movement script as the flippers, and it moved so fast in my game that you couldn't notice that you could cheat and if attempted would have probably broken the game, but due to some strange issues with build settings, the ball became 10 times slower. The same happened with the UI score count (which I also flubbed the code of, as discussed in critique), however it seems to work correctly on some computers and not correctly on others, so I am entirely confused in that regard because it'll change in both size and location. I also was not great at level design, because I didn't have enough pieces of a game in time and also I couldn't put anything too close together in case of the ball getting too large and being stuck because of the grow mechanic. Unfortunately it wasn't until critique that I realized the liberty at which everyone else had taken the word "pinball," creating games that were more unique and interesting, and I realized I could have added something as simple as spinning objects for more dynamics and movement. I definitely got caught up in realism, and lost creativity for it. If there was to be a next time I would try to think more outside the box, perhaps making the game more of an infinite fall. 

## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** - 3

*I think I gave my project a very distinct theme, and I did make the word a mechanic within the theme. However it is not all-encompassing in thematic nature as my past projects have been, but even so it ended up putting a wrench or uncertainties in a lot of my ideas.*


**Scope** - 3

This is a tricky one to answer because I feel like I never actually scoped the game, and instead built the game one piece at a time and figured I could throw together the level building together the end, and I just didn't end up thinking of and creating enough pieces to make something completely satisfactory.*


**Overall** - Pass

*It's definitely missing a lot of pieces and I wish I had done more with it, but it was a good learning experience and I think there are a lot of aspects within it that I am proud of.*
