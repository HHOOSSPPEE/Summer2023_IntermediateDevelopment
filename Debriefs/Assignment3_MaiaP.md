## **Debrief**
In this project I attempted to create a main menu for a game based on the concept of feudalism. Feudalism has always been one of my favorite topics in history class so I was super excited to grab this prompt. What I wanted to imply was a sort of level-based battle game. The kind of  mobile games that would be 2D open world, top down view with a camera that follows the player (and generally shooter as well, but this is the feudal period we're talking about so it would have to be swords and projectiles instead) and enemies spawn from all directions in great magnitude. That's why I wanted to create a character menu, because in the game I would like it if you could gain more and more equipment and skins by defeating levels, that eventually you bring yourself all the way from serfdom to kingship. I was thinking of drawing some of the equipment in the character menu, but that would be a huge and unnecessary undertaking. What I thought would be fun and doable instead was a name input, a volume slider, and a drop down for game mode that would have ideally changed the color of the background to a more intense red the higher the player upped the difficulty. Unfortunately, nothing went well. Now the whole project started out not so great with the deletion of all my files and needing to start using a new version of unity. But even with the additional days, it became clear to me that I simply did not know what I was doing. No matter how many times I rewatched the class vod, something would always not work right. My final straw was when my MusicManager script, which I had not edited at all during my trial processes, suddenly decided that it no longer could find the GameManager. The one aspect of my game that worked according to the script, no longer operable, with no understandable solution found on the internet, killed my entire drive to complete the project. I don't even think I replaced the default music and sounds that I threw in so that I could work with assets, so those are going to be violently off-theme but the whole things doesn't even play anyway so it's not like you can hear it. I really wish it had worked out, perhaps as we continue on in the semester and I gain more understanding I can come back to it, figure out where I went wrong, and fix it up. 

## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 4

*I was able to get in a few creative aspects I wanted there. I drew in masses of people with weapons in the background, the menu selection screen is a pyramid, and the numbers of the default name are the years in which Japan was feudal. Not that my game would have anything to do with Japan, they just had the most exact years out of any feudal countries I could find. I also made the volume slider a sword, which did work at one point.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 2


*I thought I did the scoping okay until I picked the one thing to do that I could not figure out. So that's just on me for taking on something new too soon.*


**Overall** - Fail


*It doesn't run. lol*
