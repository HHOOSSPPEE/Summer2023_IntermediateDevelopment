## **Debrief**

From my perspective, a "flat game" represents a genre that focuses mainly on artistic expression and the conveyance of ideas. Though at first glance it might seem like a simple walking simulator, I foresee its potential for revealing deeper meanings and insights, allowing players to explore the space freely without any pre-set directions or instructions. 
The theme of blindness resonates powerfully with this style of gameplay, as I aim to create a game that reveals profound meanings and ideas beyond the traditional goal of providing "fun". The exploratory and disoriented nature of flat games inspired me to construct a narrative around the world as perceived by blind individuals.
While keeping the sprites simple, I aim to give the sound a tangible form, using it to shape diverse personalities and narratives. This ultimately inspires players to engage their imaginations. The arrangement of objects in this game forms an abstract narrative, which I intend to keep subjective. This ensures that players can interpret the story freely from their perspectives. There are no definite stories or answers within this game; rather, players are encouraged to create their own narratives and formulate their own ideas within this open space. This exploration-focused, hollow, and deep environment is the core of my flat game, themed around blindness.
As for the aspects that I am proud of, I find the composition of the sprites and the way simple images can evoke emotion and personality to be deeply satisfying. The stylized pixelation of this game not only saved me significant time during development but also retained depth and the conveyance of ideas. I'm also satisfied with the overall ambiance of the game, achieved through a careful composition of sprites and thoughtful selection of background music.
Regarding feedback and resources, I found it gratifying to see how my classmates came up with various interpretations and thoughts upon their initial engagement with the game. Their unique perspectives inspired me to view my work through different lenses. If given the opportunity to revisit this project, I would aim to make the sprites more interconnected and harmonious to ensure the game's atmosphere remains consistent. However, one aspect I would definitely replicate is the open and free nature of the game, with the aim to inspire rather than direct players. I firmly believe that the meaning of games is imparted by the players, not by the rules. Therefore, I will definitely uphold the core principle of directionless in my game.



## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** - 5

I successfully met all the required goals and was able to present a thoughtful theme behind my game. However, one area that concerned me was the requirement to include a border while ensuring the game did not feature any collisions. In response to this, I used the coding approach from our class lessons. Players can wander beyond the visible game area, but the camera will not follow them, creating a sense of an implied boundary rather than a rigid, physical one. I perceive a hard border as a form of collision, which I wanted to avoid in keeping with the goals of the project. This technique, I believe, aligns well with the exploratory and unrestricted spirit of the game, providing players the freedom to move while subtly guiding their focus within the game's visible realm.

**Scope**  - 5


This project is reasonably time-consuming to create. Since the theme centers around blindness, the sprites were kept simple and clean. This decision meant I did not have to devote an excessive amount of time to designing complex sprites, making the project quite suitable for its one-week timeframe. Despite maintaining the simplicity of the sprites, I managed to imbue them with a variety of personalities, emotions, and stories, which I believe adds depth and interest to the gameplay experience.

**Overall** - Pass


I achieved all the required goals of the game, and the theme matched perfectly with the game.  I do not see anything I didnâ€™t put enough effort into.
