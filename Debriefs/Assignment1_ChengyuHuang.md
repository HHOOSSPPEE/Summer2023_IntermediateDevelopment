## **Debrief**
I ended up making a remake of a photo I took offhand that consisted of squares. That photo was taken in a KFC on my way back home to China. I was hungry, so I just found a random KFC and got some chicken popcorn. Although that chicken popcorn kept me waiting for a long time, the warm feeling really impressed me. So in that photo I tried to make the whole atmosphere of the photo more warm and more casual originally I was going to simply restore the photo, but then I thought adding a face to the hand would make the photo more casual and more prominent theme.The assets that I like are the game objects that I have assembled. they give me some guidelines for my future use of game objects, i.e. I need to organize the small things within the big things. This makes it easier to manage and move them around. Also the box that put the chicken popcorn was 3d, although it did not perform well but at least try to do how to do 3d in 2d.The most useful resource is some unity hands-on help from TA. For example, it is more important to figure out the light sources in unity and stuff like that, how the light sources in unity work and so on. There is also a useful resource for changing the material and color of items using materials. I think I still think it should be useful after this. For example, when I build a scene in the future, I can use different materials to change the style of the scene.Next time, I will repeat the things first of all is the way of arranging objects that I was doing before, that is, the corresponding widgets are placed inside the corresponding big items, so that it is easy to manage and not to find the game object situation. The second thing I will repeat is how to arrange the light source, after all, the light source in unity this thing is still quite difficult to understand, accidentally may appear some unexpected results, so it is better to choose a more reasonable mode to place the light source better.
But there are places to modify, the first is to start building a 2d project instead of a 3d project, using 3d projects to do 2d stuff is really painful, and in the end there will be a lot of different things to get things. Next time, don't do 2d inside 3d. The second thing to change should be the naming and stuff in the project, some naming is not intuitive enough, next time I will try to make them more intuitive.

## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

I think what I made expresses my theme of hands very well. Maybe it's a coincidence that a large part of my theme in that photo is my hands. So it was only logical that I could use this photo to express the theme of hands. At the same time I made the hands the focus of this picture, adding some personality to them, making a scene of two hands talking. By making the hands the main character, it tries to highlight the theme even more.

**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4.5

What I expect is a picture with 400+ game items. Both dark and light squares are used as shade and highlight of the image. Then unity
Generally speaking, it is in line with my expectations, that is, the strange lighting system of unity and some strange places in 3d make some shadows and highlights in my pictures do not show up, but generally speaking, it is still in line with my expectations.
But the thing is, I underestimated the complexity of the lighting system in unity 3d, and this thing is far more complicated than I thought it would be. So I ended up with something in the picture that wasn't quite what I expected. But this is a very short project after all, and I don't have much time to polish this. So that's where the points are taken away.

*My elaboration*


**Overall** - Pass

Although I started out using 3d by mistake for a start, I was very happy with the end result. I still feel pretty good by myself.
