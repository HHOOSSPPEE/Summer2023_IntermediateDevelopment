### **2023 Spring** - Yuki Hou
### *Assignment Final* 
Link to game: pushed an exe file on github


## **Debrief**
This final project had been through so many changes. At first I wanted to save the keyword "sacrifice" for some cult element but it would be hard to make one. Then my friend recommanded me the game Warioware and I absolutely love how the gameplay consists of many minigames and narrative. My initial thought was to include many goofy character narratives and simple minigames, connected by a bunch of scene transitions. With that being said, I started to work on the narrative story and script. It's hard to make a fun narrative, but I do wish to make each character's personality unique. So I spent sometime making different emotion animations and sound effects for the character. I really like the character voice from undertale so I looked up tutorials that make the kind of voice. However it didn't quite fit the fungus system I'm using, or maybe because I didn't find the correct way to do it, the final voiceover didnt' sound as I expected. But there's not much time for that, there's a long way until the end of the game. I initially planned to make six minigames, but there's not enough time to make them. I have to spend like a whole day to make just one simple minigame and its narrative work so I only had time to make four of them. My friend who knows how to code in unity assisted me a lot in this project, like when the code is not working I'll send him a screenshot or invite him in parsec to look at the code and that saved a ton of debugging time. However, at the time I finished two games, I felt a sudden pressure for no reason. Like how am I suppose to make this game fun, if my narrative is not fun and all I can focus is the art aspect. I almost wanted to change the narrative game into a roguelite adventure game so that at least the player can enjoy the gameplay more. But then I feel like okay whatever, I'm not good at coding anyways so whatever I end up making I should appreciate my work. It's also because I want to make this game into a gift for my friend, so some part of the story is based on whatever happend to me and my friend in reality. I'm not sure how it feels if a player without any previous knowledge plays the game and sees the narrative, but I'm sure my friend will get it. There's not enough time for me to make an ending game that the player can interact with different game objects, so I made it into a full narrative cutscene even if the player don't click on it the conversations goes. And it's so sad that the exe file export of my game still contains so many weird bugs, like sprites not showing up or maybe layer error. They are hard to avoid because nothing weird happend when I play the game in my project. I'm not sure if the sky of the final cutscene is moving but I intentionally designed that to show that time is flying the two characters had been in situation like this for a long time. (I don't think it showed up in the exe file when I played it but I already pushed it I think the game still works without it.) And afterthat I went on free music websites and browsed a bunch of no copyright soundeffects that I can use in my game to make it feel more complete. 

## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

My project might not meet the theme that much? But I want the "sacrifice" to be understood as "sacrificing time and spend it with people close to you". I want it to be like at first it's "sacrificing" becausing you could have done something else instead but you're forced to complete these tasks, but as the game continues, the character realized this is just a normal thing, like spending time with friends is normal and the character should never see spending time with other people as a sacrifice. I'm not sure if it's clear enough in the game because I don't understand how I want this whole sacrificing time thing to be either. 


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5
This game is actually way beyond what I could make like I spent so much time on it. Like I want to make it into a good, completed work, but it's also very challenging especially I haven't had much experience working with unity and I'm not good at designing gameplay. I'm glad I have fungus system to help me make the game going. 

*My elaboration*

I should be proud of this project I made, although there's so much more that I could have done better, and nothing was working at the last minutes. The webgl wasn't working, the github pushing wasn't working. I was really depressed when nothing is going well but I'm glad it eventually works. 

**Overall** - Pass
