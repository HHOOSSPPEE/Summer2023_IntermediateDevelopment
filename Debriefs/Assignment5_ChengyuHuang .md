## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the gameâ€™s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

I ended up making a shoot them up game. The player needs to operate an airplane and shoot down incoming enemies, each time the player shoots down an enemy the game speeds up. Conversely, if the player misses an enemy, the game slows down. As the player's speed increases, the faster the player moves, the faster the enemies move, the faster the enemies shoot, but the player's weapons are also upgraded as the speed increases. When the player can't cope with the bullets filling the screen and thus deducting all their life points, the player enters Fight For Your Life mode, where the player extends their life each time they destroy an enemy, and also gains a little bit of time for hitting bullets, so this essentially encourages the player to utilize the speed they've saved up before to rampage through this stage. To emphasize the theme of being fast. Ultimately, when the player says Too Fast himself, then the ultimate goal of the game is achieved. My favorite aspect is the player, as there are a ton of components crammed on top of the player. First, to create a silky smooth and satisfying movement system, I gave the player some inertia so that when they stopped moving they would have an overshoot due to inertia, simulating aerial braking. To go along with this inertia, the player also has a silky smooth movement animation to make the movement look less monotonous. Lastly, in order to express the player's blood level in stages so that the player doesn't have to look at their life as often, I added some particle effects to the player so that when the player's life is low, the player's ship will catch on fire and alert them. Another thing I really like is the enemies that chase the player and shoot them. There are only three types of enemies at the beginning of the game, and the main threat at the beginning of the game are the enemies that will spread out and shoot, but once the game speeds up to a certain point, the bullets won't be able to keep up with the enemies, so the player can safely hide in corners and shoot them easily with missiles. This wasn't the result I was looking for, so I added an enemy that would chase the player and shoot at them, this enemy wasn't a threat at the beginning, but after speeding up would fire a thick wall of bullets at the player in the corner to stop the player from using the best solution.Basically, the suggestions I've heard work pretty well, but the most useful ones are the stuff inside the input system, and some of the optimization stuff.Something that will be repeated next time is more of a juice effect, and why not?


Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

I think it fits the theme because the game gradually speeds up until the player loses control of everything, thus embodying the theme of going too fast.


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4.8

There were actually some other things that I didn't have time to do because of time, namely a bomb that clears all targets kind of thing, and the fact that the player bullet speed increases with speed, but because of that it led to some weird bugs so it's just gone, but those are just little things is all. But I think most of the stuff is still great, so I'll give myself a 4.8?


*Write your elaboration within the asterixis*


**Overall** - Pass/Fail Pass
This would have to be the best work done on the location so far, PASS!
