## **Debrief**
So I tried to turn Plants vs Zombies into a potion-based drunk scientist game with inspirations drawn from Minecraft as well. I do think the final product ended up being a little closer to PvZ than I intended it to me, because while trying to come up with a new map configuration I realized why the original was made the way it was, and I shouldn't waste my time trying to reinvent the wheel when there are other ways to bring new life to the game. So I gave the enemies a lot more free movement, the attacks less permanent once planted, and of course the ability to mix potions before throwing them down. I really enjoyed trying to figure out the ins and outs of how a grid placement game worked, because with so many objects in the room there are a lot of overlapping colliders that you have to manage and figure out how you will decide which triggers should produce an outcome. I also leaned a lot about the bridge between UI and regular scene interactions. Most issues I had were able to be googled, and I could easily find a helpful function that gave me the solution I needed. However I did have to follow one tutorial on dragging and dropping sprites that I didn't completely understand but was able to make work, however I used trial and error to fix a scaling issue that ended up not being translated correctly during the building process. Which was unfortunate and disappointing, but it didn't take too much away from gameplay so that was positive. I was proud of my pixel art, camera movement, and general feel of the game. However I did hear from everyone and my own personal play testers that the UI was confusing due to the lack of communication about how the UI is supposed to function. This is definitely due to my tutorial being subpar, and being more of a level than a tutorial. If I had more time, or perhaps in the future, I can go in and add a lot more visual indicators to players from making so many mistakes, or not realizing when they are able to make another potion due to a cooldown they aren't aware of. I would have added a more transparent sprite, however the program I was drawing on didn't have any alpha settings in the color wheel. Perhaps I should try a different one.


## **Self Evaluation**


**Execution** - 5

*I implemented the theme of Flask into multiple aspects of the game, the first being the mixing and throwing of potions as attacks, then in the alcoholic sense with the drunkenness, and a nod to science with the scientist enemies.*


**Scope** - 4


*I finished building all the pieces of the game fairly close to the deadline, allowing me only two days for level creation and decorative art. As a result, the tutorial I was aiming to create fell short due to my lack of time and energy to fight code, however doing so allowed for multi-level production instead of just one, which felt like a big enough take for a final project.*


**Overall** - Pass


*This is the biggest uptake I have done on a project before, and worked all day every day, and can say I am very happy with the results and they are up to mine and this project's standards. I also got the main menu scene change working, which has not been any of my projects thus far.*
