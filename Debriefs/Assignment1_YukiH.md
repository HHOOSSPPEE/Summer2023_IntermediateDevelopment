## **Debrief**
For this first assignment, I ended up making a collection of Unity game objects that look like the picture I took when they were put together. I really like that this assignment does not have any hard-core coding, and it allows us to express our creativity while getting more familiar with the interface of Unity. I'm not good at Unity but I've made some animations with this software before so this assignment was not that difficult. It's fun to play with 2D primitive shapes in unity because I've only worked with 3D objects in the previous classes I've taken. Since I usually use clipping masks/ mask in digital drawings, I tried to look up online about how to use masks in unity. It was a bit confusing but it worked in the end, although it didn't work the way I want it to. I believe I have to separate the sorting layer or something so that I can assign them to different masks. (But I don't think I'm going to use masks in the future since we'll be using our own assets.) I'll repeat presenting something that I think is fun or something that I feel could be a presentable artwork next time.
