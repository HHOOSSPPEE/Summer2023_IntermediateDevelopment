## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

The theme of this GameJam is role reversal. So we ended up making a somewhat strange game of figuring out how to kill off game characters. Since our theme was role reversal, we wanted to make the player not play as the "player" but as the game designer. So we made a dodge game, but this time the PC would be the one doing the dodging, and the player would be the one placing the traps and bullets.In this game the player has to make all sorts of contraptions to hurt the player before the time runs out, and to make sure the game doesn't end too soon. If the game ends too soon, it's too hard, and if the countdown ends, it's too easy. We made a fake unity scene to simulate this. There are all kinds of traps to hurt the player, mines, iron blocks, and turrets. To add depth to these things, we added mechanics that could be chain-triggered, such as mines that would explode continuously, or iron blocks that could be propelled by conveyor belts or rockets, or TNT. these all added depth, and to allow the player to make a machine that could be played consistently, we made a chicken drumstick to lure the PCs to a specific place. My favorite aspects are a bunch of pixel art I've done, because in addition to my game design I'm also responsible for doing pixel art and a few other things. Although my drawings don't compare to other students who specialize in art, I'm still glad to see that the art I did played a big part in the game. The next thing I'm happy about is the chicken legs, which were a troll idea we had while working on the game. We added weird sound effects to the chicken drumsticks and "fried" our game designer! The most helpful advice was to aim low, so I started out designing the game with just a few core features and didn't make it very complex. So our team didn't feel a lot stress. The thing we will repeat. Is to aim low at first, and then if we have time add more thing to it. Because it is a 48 hour gamejam, we don’t have a lot time to do the game play and level design part. So aim low before start develop determine a core gameplay part that will reflect the game theme.


Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 4
The theme this time is role reverse so that we do reverse the role of player and developer. But we still need more design to try to enhance that. But we reflect most theme.

*Write your elaboration within the asterixis*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4

Most meet my plan the only missing is more prefab and more narrative stuff. Must we still meet the goal. Because it is a 48-hour GameJam I can’t expect more.

*Write your elaboration within the asterixis*


**Overall** - Pass/Fail Pass
Overall, first gameJam We did a good job. We finished the game!
