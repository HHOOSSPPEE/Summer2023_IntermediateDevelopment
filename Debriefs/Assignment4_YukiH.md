## **Debrief**
The pinball machine got me quite confused about what game to make for the assignment. Although it doesn't have to be a pinball machine, I feel like I can't think of games other than a pinball machine that plays well with different types of physics interaction. And my theme for this assignment is perseverance, which in my opinion could be something like the player's persistence in shooting pegs over and over to reach a goal. At first, I want to make it into a pinball boss fight, so there's going to be a monster in the middle of the screen, and the surrounding spinning objects are mud texture that slows down the pegs touching them. So instead of scores I would keep track of damage dealt and the amount of attack the player initiated. But I feel like it's hard to make a health system, especially since there wasn't enough time left, and my coding skill is like really bad I need constant help from youtube. So I want to make it easy for myself, I instead made the boss into a gold machine. It's like those click-to-get-money games but instead, you want the peg to hit the gold to get money. And I want the game to not be so easy, so I set a base money charge for each peg the player uses, and these charges get higher as the player uses more pegs. I also wanted to make a water/jelly-like material with circles, which Samira taught me how to do on Tuesday, but it ended up going crazy these circles will bounce frequently like monster creatures. So I had to connect them to four more circles that are hidden underneath the walls next to them to make them stay in place. I used primitive shapes because that's what pinball is like in my opinion. Like I feel it's less like a pinball machine if I add too much customization to it. I also wanted the game to be chaotic so the player can have multiple pegs in the machine at the same time and they can control the flipper inside the machine to make the ball bounce up. However, if there are too many pegs at the same time some pegs will crash into the wall and get stuck. It usually won't happen, because the more pegs the player uses, the more charge the peg will cost, so the player has to wait until they have enough money for the next peg.

## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 4.5

My project meets my theme. I wish I could spend more time to make it into a boss fight though. I think persisting attack to get rid of a monster is more like "perseverance".


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*My elaboration*

I feel like I scoped this assignment the way I want it to. The buttons works well, the pegs are bouncing super chaoticlly which is exactly what I wanted.

**Overall** - Pass


It should be an okay work.:)
