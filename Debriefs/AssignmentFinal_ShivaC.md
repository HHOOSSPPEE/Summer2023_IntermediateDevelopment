## **Debrief**
I made a game based on Alien Squatter. Alien Squatter is an exploration RPG so, with limited time, I recreated basic examples of character selection, conversational stats, different styles of dialogue branching, tiled movement and more. I started with the movement system. Each time you move to another tile, it depletes your energy (the core exploration mechanic of Alien Squatter). What's implemented from that system is when you run out of energy, your character will fall over and reset to their initial spawn point. There's not a ton to explore, but I made two interactable NPCs loitering next to their tents. 

This is when I learned a lot more... I downloaded Ink (narrative scripting software) and spent a lot of time figuring out how to integrate that with Unity in different ways. I got stuck for a bit debugging communication between an Ink file and a c# script. I was assigning the player's conversational stats (charm, strength, and psychic power)to variables created in the Ink file, which was being used in its own if/else statements to display different options. Eventually I figured it out and realized, Ink is super awesome. I made another dialogue (the man in lotus position) that uses different functionalities from Alien Squatter: looping branches and one-use dialogue choices.

What I like about the project is the purple guy in the intro. I like the basic setup and ideas I have for the future. I like the way dialogue is set up mechanically. Aesthetically the game is incoherent and somewhat ugly to me. If I put more time into it, I would redo the dialogue choices to be in one panel rather than separated UI buttons, I would make the UI windows dynamically scalable to the text they're displaying, I would make the intro more cinematic (car was meant to drive along while you get a couple lines of exposition), and I would make sound effects for everything. I think it has potential to be cool and I had fun playing with Unity for this, though at the end was rushing to make it all work.

## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

The style of the game is exploration, and there's hidden dialogue choices depending on what character you choose. There's landmarks out of the camera's view that you can find as well. My theme for this was "secret"


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


Well. I started getting preoccupied with smaller details and exploring Unity tutorials, especially on integrating with Ink and the different ways you can structure dialogue, but I eventually reigned it in to finish a solid range of simplified mechancis from Alien Squatter. I like the tiled movement and tiled collision system.


**Overall** - Pass

Overall, I'm happy with what I learned while making this project and I genuinely plan to continue working on it. I want to add a lot more to the visual presentation, narrative and pacing. Right now there's not enough content to consider pacing, but once I add options to increase your attributes and energy, I think it could be a really cool mystery.
