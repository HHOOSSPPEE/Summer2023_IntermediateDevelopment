## **Debrief**
It took me a while to decide which keyword I want to use for this assignment because it's a flat game, which restricted any interaction or collision between the player and game object. And I never really played a flat game before so I can't imagine what a game without interaction should look like. I don't think I can use the word "Mine" because I want to save it for later if I get a chance to make a 2d mining game that is sort of a combination of core keeper and don't starve.I like their mining animation and sound effect like I can do nothing but mining for half an hour straight. Another of my key word is "perseverance" and I feel like it might fit the requirement of this assignment but I sort of want to save it for a word game, which I'll probably use next week for the next dialogue game. I want to use "myth" the last for my final but I ended up using it for this project because I sort of just started playing around with the unity project before I really decided which theme to use. And myth became the most reasonable choice. It's really weird that the player controller that I wrote step by step in class didn't work. The player won't move although it detects my input. Through debugging, I see that the player input data is detected but the last frame position remains the same, which got me quite confused because I checked the script and if the player transform position is working, then the last frame position should be changing. So I went back and watched the recording but a lot of the naming is different than my preference I sometimes confuses myself with the naming and I still didn't quite understand which line did I miss or typed wrong so I ended up using another old method I tried before. Also, I can't really check if the animator controller was working because the movement script didn't work so I used the method I've learned before as well. I feel like the animator logic that I used is actually very effective for this specific up down left right movement animation and I only need a blend tree to make it work. Yet, I don't think it'll work for more complicated movements or if it has more than four directions. The camera movement worked well, I really liked the smoothed camera follow that we learned in class. I've always had trouble understanding the camera logic in game maker studio but I think it seems better in Unity. For animation, I tried the traditional frame-by-frame animation for the movement, and I tried 2D skinning for some of the environment objects. If it's possible in the future, I actually want to start using Live2D SDK in Unity because it has better smoothed 2D skinning than the one Unity has. It works sort of like Spine but I think Live2D SDK comes with a bunch of parameters and scripts that I can use in Unity and I need some time to figure that out. I wish I could get a chance to use it maybe in next week's project or the final project.

## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

My procject meet the theme of myth, sort of? I tried to create a environment where the tree looks like they are some living things with weird animation. 


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*My elaboration*

I feel like I scoped this assignment the way I want it to.It meets the requirement of the assignment. 

**Overall** - Pass


It should be an okay work.:)
