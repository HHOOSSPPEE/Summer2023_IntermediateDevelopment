## **Debrief**
In this project, I end up making a scene of the cherry blossoms inside Washington square park and the people who seem to enjoy the season. The game aspect that I enjoyed the most during this project was trying to figure out the depth of each graphic; at first, I thought the game was happening in a 2D world; however, later on, I figured out that it is in a 3D world but displaced as a 2D perspective. The resource that was most help for me was the help from TA, which when I faced a question that I tried to answer but couldn't, I brought it to the lab section, and she helped me fix the problem I got. Comments from my classmates are also constructive during the process; they help me to understand my weakness and what I'm good at, so I can make changes based on what I am good or bad at. What I will repeat next time is to finish the project beforehand and bring the question to the lab section so I can get some answers back before it is too late. What I will do differently next time is I will save more often so I don't lose my document during an accident.


## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

I think my project meets the theme I gave it, my theme was Lush, by presenting the blooming cherry blossoms and their leaves, I present a Lush scene.


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4


I will scope my project as very good, in the project, I think I present the scene of cherry blossoms not only in the way it supposes to be but also add some of my own thinking inside, to make it different and better, such as the change on the viewpoint. And also by adjusting each tree, they are different from each other, to make them more realistic.


**Overall** - Pass


I think because my project fit the theme I give to it, and the work I had spent to make the project, I will say it passed the requirements.
