## **Debrief**

I ended up choosing the theme "Mirror" and taking a picture of a mirror while I was walking with a friend. It was in front of the store Mother of Junk. My friend and I were in the mirror. I thought this would be a good picture because I could draw characters, which I prefer to do over landscapes. I liked organizing my Unity layout and learning to use Source Tree. The Zoom recording was helpful and gave me all I needed to complete the project. If I could do anything differently, it would be to not draw with Unity primitives. It's tedious and my final result is ugly, I think.


## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

Yes, the subect of the drawing is a mirror which was the theme.


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4


Well. I got the idea across, learned the basics of depth and creating a scene, and didn't spend too much time perfecting a project that I don't plan on developing further.


**Overall** - Pass


I drew a picture with the minimum required number of objects depicting a mirror and its reflection, which fits straightforwardly into my chosen theme, "Mirror."
